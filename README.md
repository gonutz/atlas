atlas
=====

This library can be used to create (not read) images atlases. That is, combine multiple images into one. This is useful in games with many small textures. Having one large texture and addressing sub-rectangles in it is more efficient than having many small textures and swapping between them.

See [the documentation](https://godoc.org/github.com/gonutz/atlas) for an API overview.
